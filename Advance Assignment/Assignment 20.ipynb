    "The decimal declared as a float is not technically 0.01, which results in an equality test of false. All decimals should be initialized using strings to prevent precision issues. If decimals aren't initialized with strings, we lose some of the precision benefits of decimals and create subtle bugs."

    "\n",
    "Normally Decimal is used to avoid the floating point precision problem. For example, the float literal 71.60 isn't mathematically 71.60 , but a number very close to it. As a result, using float to initialize Decimal won't avoid the problem. "
